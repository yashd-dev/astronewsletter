        Cryptography, a word with Greek origins, means, ‚Äúsecret writing.‚Äù It is
        a technique of securing information and communications through codes so
        that only those people for whom the information is intended can
        understand and process it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        In simpler terms when you send a letter to someone while it is traveling
        to its destination the letter can be read by anyone whereas with
        cryptography you are sending a letter in a locked box that can be only
        opened by you or the person you want to send it to.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Mainly used to defend against passive security attacks. Passive security
        attacks are attacks where attackers aim to take data from the user hence
        cryptography remains important to protecting data and users, ensuring
        confidentiality, and preventing cyber criminals from intercepting
        sensitive corporate information. To unlock your phone, you must enter a
        password then it compares with the one stored in it. Without
        cryptography the password could be extracted from the storage of your
        phone and then be used to open it. Now there are many ways and
        algorithms of encrypting data, but that uses complex mathematical
        equations to make it secure. But for the sake of simplicity, we'll use
        the example of Caesar Cipher. It is one of the simplest and most widely
        known encryption techniques to start off our journey in the world of
        encryption.

      <p>
        The way this works is you take the text you want to encrypt and shift
        every letter by a fixed number (let's call it K) of letters in the
        alphabet. So, if your number K is 2, then A becomes C, B becomes D, C
        becomes E etc. and Z cycles over and becomes B. The message ATTACK, with
        k=3 is encrypted to DWWDFM. To decrypt, you simply shift the letters in
        the opposite direction! D shifted back by 3 positions becomes A, W
        shifted becomes T and so on...

      <h3>In general there are three types of cryptography:</h3>
      <ol class="[&>*]:pb-4">
        <li>
          Symmetric Key Cryptography: It is an encryption system where the
          sender and receiver of message use a single common key to encrypt and
          decrypt messages. Explaining with a padlock analogy would be better.
          <ul class="[&>*]:py-2">
            <li>
              Imagine Alice and Bob both have the same padlock and key. They
              have previously agreed on using this specific padlock and key for
              their communication. This key is their shared secret.
            </li>
            <li>
              If Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob, she puts her
              message in a box and locks it with the shared padlock using the
              shared key.
            </li>
            <li>
              {" "}
               When Bob receives the locked box, he uses the same shared key to
              unlock it, revealing the message inside.
            </li>
          </ul>
           It is a simpler method of encryption but the problem here is how do
          you share the key with the other person safely without anyone else
          intercepting?
        </li>
        <li>
          Asymmetric Key Cryptography: Under this system a pair of keys is used
          to encrypt and decrypt information. A receiver's public key is used
          for encryption and a receiver's private key is used for decryption.
          Public key and Private Key are different. Even if the public key is
          known by everyone the intended receiver can only decode it because he
          alone knows his private key. Similar example as above:
          <ul class="[&>*]:py-2">
            <li>
              Alice and Bob each have their own unique pair of a padlock (public
              key) and a unique key (private key).
            </li>
            <li>
              If Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob, she uses Bob's
              public padlock (key) to lock the message (encrypt it). Alice
              cannot unlock it once it's locked.
            </li>
            <li>
              When Bob receives the locked message, he uses his private key
              (unique key) to unlock it, revealing the message inside. Nobody
              else can unlock it because only Bob has the unique key that
              matches his padlock.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Hashing: It is a process in which a mathematical algorithm takes an
          input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-length string of characters,
          which is typically a sequence of numbers and letters. The output,
          called the hash value or hash code, is unique to the specific input
          data. It is extremely difficult (practically impossible) to reverse
          the process and obtain the original input from the hash value. This
          property makes it useful for securely storing passwords and ensuring
          data integrity.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        But this is also a problem as for the same input, the hash function will
        always produce the same hash value. This means that if two users have
        the same password, they will also have the same hash value. This is a
        security risk, as it allows attackers to find users with the same
        password.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome this problem, salt can be added to the input before hashing.
        A salt is a random string of characters that is added to the input of
        hash functions to produce unique hash values for the same input. This
        makes it impossible for attackers to find users with the same password.
      </p>

        Have you ever heard of a computer that can do things regular computers
        can't? These special computers are called quantum computers. They are
        different from the computers you use at home or school because they use
        something called ‚Äúqubits‚Äù instead of regular ‚Äúbits.‚Äù A bit is like a
        light switch that can only be on or off, like a zero or a one. But a
        qubit can be both zero and one at the same time! This means quantum
        computers can do many things at once and work much faster than regular
        computers. It's like having many helpers working on a task together
        instead of just one. One application of it would be quantum
        cryptography.

        Quantum cryptography isn't just another buzzword in the world of
        technology; it's a transformative leap into a new era of secure
        communication. In a world where data breaches and cyberattacks have
        become all too common, the need for unbreakable encryption has never
        been greater. That's where quantum cryptography steps in. Imagine a
        world where your digital secrets are truly safe, beyond the reach of
        even the most advanced hackers and supercomputers. This is the promise
        of quantum cryptography. Unlike classical encryption, which relies on
        mathematical algorithms, quantum cryptography leverages the strange and
        wondrous properties of quantum mechanics.
      </p>
      <blockquote>But how does it work?</blockquote>
      <p>
        At the heart of quantum cryptography is a concept called Quantum Key
        Distribution (QKD). It uses qubits as keys. These qubits have the
        remarkable ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, a
        property known as superposition. If anyone tries to intercept or measure
        them, their quantum state instantly changes, revealing the intrusion.
        It's like having a lock that not only keeps your secrets safe but also
        alerts you if someone tries to tamper with it.

        The applications of quantum cryptography are vast and transformative. It
        secures communication, protecting messages and data from prying eyes. It
        safeguards financial transactions, ensures the privacy of medical
        records, and even strengthens the integrity of elections. Quantum
        cryptography is the answer to a future where digital threats are
        constantly evolving, and traditional encryption methods may become
        vulnerable to quantum attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's not just about security; it's about being at the forefront of a
        technological revolution. Quantum technology is poised to redefine
        industries, from computing to communication. Understanding quantum
        cryptography isn't just about staying safe in a digital age‚Äîit's about
        shaping that age, pioneering new frontiers in science and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intriguingly, quantum cryptography isn't science fiction; it's
        cutting-edge reality. It's the digital fortress that empowers
        individuals, businesses, and governments to communicate and exchange
        information with unwavering confidence. So, if you're curious about the
        future of secure communication and want to be part of a digital
        revolution, quantum cryptography is your gateway to a world where
        secrets remain truly secret.

        Fluid intake monitoring is an essential component in preventing
        dehydration and overhydration, especially for the senior population.
        Numerous critical health problems are associated with poor or excessive
        drinking such as swelling of the brain and heart failure. Real-time
        systems for monitoring fluid intake will not only measure the exact
        amount consumed by the users but could also motivate people to maintain
        a healthy lifestyle by providing feedback to encourage them to hydrate
        regularly throughout the day. It's easy to believe that when it comes to
        hydration, more is always better. But that's not necessarily the case as
        mentioned above. To tackle this problem, we can come up with a solution
        for a smart water bottle.
      </p>
      <figure class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
        <img
          src="/Ed1-Top3.jpg"

        <figcaption class="flex items-center justify-center">
          A Human Filling Water Bottle
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <blockquote>Technical Details:</blockquote>
      <p>
        The smart bottle would have a whole slew of sensors on the bottles
        bottom for accurately detecting the level of water in the bottle like an
        ultrasonic sensor that emits sound waves and measure the time it takes
        for the waves to bounce back after hitting the water surface. By
        calculating the time, it takes for the signal to return, you can
        determine the distance from the sensor to the water surface, which
        represents the water level in the bottle, or a weight sensor placed
        under the bottle can measure the change in weight as water is consumed.
        By tracking the weight difference, you can estimate the remaining water
        level!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the data collected is sent to a server that is owned by the bottle
        makers or a self-hosted approach could be provided. The data would just
        consist of the amount of water you have consumed, but meaningful
        conclusions must be made from it. This is where machine learning comes
        into play. A predefined ML model is initially used, basis on the user's
        age, diseases, external environment etc. The model is then trained on
        the data collected from the user and the model is updated. You can then
        predict the amount of water the user should consume in a day and the
        amount of water the user has consumed in a day. The user is notified if
        he is not drinking enough water.
